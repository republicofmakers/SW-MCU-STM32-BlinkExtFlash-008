It boots from external flash, it is for H743 MCU.

You can edit and upload large size of codes to your external flash.

You dont need to depend on microcontroller flash memory. It is not enough most of the time.

Dont forget to upload, project 007-Bootloader code first. Otherwise this project will not work.

Hope this helps you,
